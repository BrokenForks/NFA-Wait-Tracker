# NFA-Wait-Tracker
Now you can track every single excruciating day while waiting in NFA hell.
This program is designed to keep track of how many days you have been waiting for the ATF to approve your various
forms. Add information about your suppressors, SBRs, and machine guns to the tracker, it will show you how many
days you have been waiting on the ATF to approve them. The information is saved automatically to your hard drive
in a file named "NFAWait.ser" that is created in the same directory where the compiled program is run from.
